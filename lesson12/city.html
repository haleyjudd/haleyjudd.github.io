                <h2>History</h2>
                <p><img src="images/mill.jpg" alt="";>Peru is a town in the eastern part of 
                Clinton County, NY, just south of Plattsburgh, NY.
                 Nestled between the Adirondack Mountains and 
                 Lake Champlain, the Town of Peru was formed 
                 from Plattsburgh and Willsborough on Dec.
                  28, 1792. A part of it was annexed back 
                  to Willsborough in 1799 and the towns of 
                  Ausable and Black Brook were taken off in
                  1839. Its present boundaries are the towns
                   of Saranac, Schuyler Falls and Plattsburgh
                    on the north, the towns of Ausable and
                Black Brook on the south, Lake Champlain on 
                the east and the town of Black Brook on the 
                west. The area of the town is approximately 
                seventy-nine square miles. Some of the early 
                settlers thought that the mountains surrounding 
                the town resembled those of Peru, South America. 
                Hence, the origin of the town's name. The 
                earliest concentration of settlers was in 
                an area called the "Union", a Quaker settlement 
                in the vicinity of the present Keese Homestead 
                and Quaker Cemetery on what is now Union Road. 
                 early Quaker settlers or "Friends" as they 
                 preferred to be called, were mainly farmers 
                 and came from Dutchess County, NY and previously 
                 England. Some of the family names of those pioneer
                  settlers still abound in the town today: Allen, 
                  Arnold, Baker, Elmore, Everett, Hay(s), Keese 
                  and Thew, to mention a few.</p>

                <h2>Agriculture</h2>
                <p><img src="images/apple1.jpg" alt="";>Peru has open fields and fertile land to grow
                    many successful types of crops. Through out 
                    the year you will see workers dedicated to the
                    trees and fields that provide ample harvest.
                    Corn, hay and berries grow plentifully in Peru 
                    however, the main crop is apples. Thousand and thousand
                    of acres of a variety of apples stretch across
                    the fields of Peru with beautiful apple blossems in the spring
                    that turn into bright red, apples in the fall. 
                    Peru is also the home several large dairy farms
                    that dot the landscape and provide a strong odor
                    when the weather warms up.

                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p><img src="images/pop.jpg" alt="";>The present population of Peru is 6,998 
                    according to the 2010 census. Long 
                    gone are most of the timber and iron
                    related industries and the many mills 
                    that once lined the banks of Peru's 
                    rivers. Fires have taken their toll on
                    many buildings in the center of the 
                    village. It is now a relatively quiet
                    semi-rural residential area surrounded
                    by thousands of acres of apple orchards
                    and dairy farms.</p>

                <h2>Things to Do</h2>
                <p><img src="images/view.jpg" alt="";>Peru is located in the Adirondack mountains.
                    There are count less trails to hike, lakes to kayak
                    and scenery to take your breath away. A 35 minute drive
                    through the mountains will bring you to Lake Placid where
                    the winter Olymics were hosted twice. 10 minutes to the 
                    East will bring you to Lake Champlain, home of Champy our
                    local lake monster. A 20 minute ferry ride will land you
                    in Burlington, VT where you can visit Church St. If you feel
                    like staying awhile and need a challenge you can join the
                    elite club the 46ers by successfully hiking all of the 46 peaks
                    in the Adirondack mountains. If you're an early riser, you can
                    park at the Mother Cabrini's Shrine & St. Patrick's Oratory for
                    a breathtaking view of the sunrise. No matter what your interest
                    you will enjoy visiting our little corner of paradise.
